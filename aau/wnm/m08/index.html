    Things I like to do
  </h2>
  <p>In my free time I like to play pc games with my friends in my discord servers or just watch anime I am currently watching One Piece. 
    Whenever I am not playing on my pc I am always working so I can ensure I am, able to pay for school. 
    And whenever I am not working or playing on my pc I am with my ferrets they are literally like a small cat but more feisty.</p>
