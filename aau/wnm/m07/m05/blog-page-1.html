  <p>The elder scrolls online has been around for years. Before its launch it was rumored to be a subsribtion based game like fina fantasy online
    this was swiftly shut down. To this day The Elder Scrolls online is still very popular Bethesda is still releasing add ons and making so much more armor and weapons. So far there is about 160 different dungeons in the game.
    And then there are the trials which there are currently around 15 or so they add 2 or three trials per add on release the game still has momentum and it doesnt look to be slowing down anytime soon.
