  <p> A couple of weeks ago bungie finally unveiled their roadmap for destiny 2 in the year 2025 the dlc will be clled frontiers. Bungie did very well with the final shape release
    but sony did not think they did good enough so they did a takeover of the studio and now are reanranging the whole staffing structure for the studio.
    But these changes have been met with mixed reviews some like the changes but some don,t. It was rumored that pete parsons the ceo of Bungie was stealing money to buy super expensive race cars while employees were struggling to pay gracery bills.
    its still not known if this is actually true but only the future will tell.
